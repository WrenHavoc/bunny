# bunny
a super simple rabbit (fork bomb) made in bash. Will crash most systems in seconds. I made this for a friend.
This software is provided with no terms or conditions, however I request that you not be a dick while using this.

# ----------[Version 2.0.0]----------
Re-wrote the entire malware in python.

## New Features
  * The malware should now be cross-platform (untested)
  * Added a gui for the rabbits that appear on-screen
  * rabbits appearing are now purely for fun and can be easily removed
  * faster system crashing (artificially slowed for the visuals but this can be easily removed)

## Planned Features
  * worm-like spreading
  * versions with different animals (you'll get your cat Isa)
  * customizable messages
  * "stealth version" with no visual elements
  * "evil version" which always runs on system start
Let me know if you have any other suggestions!
